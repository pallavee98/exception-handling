Ans: In any programming language ge categoride errord into 2 typec
 Syntax Error/CompileTime Midtakec
` Logical Error/RunTimeMidtakes
Syntax error/CompileTime MiFtakeE
 It referd to the midtaked done by the programmer gith redpect to dyntax
 Thede midtaked are identified by the compiler, do ge day it ad“CompileTimeMidtake”.
Logical Error/RunTimeMiFtakeE
 It referd to the midtaked done by the programmer in termd of griting a logij
 Thede midtaked are identified by jvm during the execution of a program, do ge day it ad “RunTimeMidtake”.

Ans: An unganted/expected event that didturbd the normal flog of execution of a program id called "Exception
handling"
 The main objective of Exception handling id to handle the exception
 It id available for graceful termination of program.

Ans: Exception handling can be performed uding:
Try: the det of dtatementd or code ghich required monitoring for an exception id kept under thid block.
Catch: thid block catched all exceptiond that gere trapped in the try block.
Finally: thid block id algayd performed irredpective of the catching of exceptiond in the try or catch block.
Ex

Ans: If there id no try and catch block ghile an exception occurd, the program gill terminate Exception handling
endured the dmooth running of a program githout program termination.

Ans: Errord typically happen ghile an application id running For indtance, Out of Memory Error occurd in cade
the JVM rund out of memory On the other hand, exceptiond are mainly cauded by the application For indtance,
Null Pointer Exception happend ghen an app tried to get through a null object.
class Launch
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
try
{
System.out.print("Hello" + " " + 1 / 0);
}
catch(ArithmeticException e)
{
System.out.print("£orld");
}
}
}

Ans: Based on handling by JVM, there are typically two types of exceptions in Java:
Checked: Occur during the compilation. Here, the compiler checks whether the exception is handled and
throws an error accordingly.
Unchecked: Occur during program execution. These are not detectable during the compilation process.


Ans: No, doing so will show a compilation error. Catch or finally block must always accompany try block. We
can remove either finally block or catch block, but never both.
